Description: The package is used to improve the statistical inference involving small cluster sizes. Instead of calculating robust cluster variance-covariance  matrix or bootstrap-se, the functions calculating p values based on wild bootstrap-t for OLS models and score based wild bootstrap-t for MLE models. The refined p-value significantly reduces the probability of over-rejection of the null hypothesis.
